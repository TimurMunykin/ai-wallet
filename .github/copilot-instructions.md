# AI Chat with UI Snippets

This project is a React TypeScript application that creates a chat interface with the ability to render dynamic UI components generated by OpenAI.

## Key Features
- Real-time chat interface with OpenAI integration
- Dynamic UI snippet rendering using React and Babel
- Safe component compilation and execution
- Tailwind CSS for modern styling
- TypeScript for type safety

## Development Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error handling for dynamic code execution
- Maintain type safety throughout the application
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Keep components focused and reusable

## Security Considerations
- Dynamic code execution is sandboxed
- OpenAI API key should be handled securely
- Component rendering includes error boundaries
